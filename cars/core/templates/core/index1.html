<h1>Toyota supra</h1><br>
<p>Others will tell you to keep in mind the 1998 Toyota Supra is over two decades old. Sure it was designed at the end of the 1980’s, but the Mark 4 Supra is still competitive today. For the sake of brevity, we will focus on the Toyota Supra Turbo price. Each example was powered by a 3.0L straight six engine.
Any Toyota Supra straight six engine is a work of art

Because of the sequential compressors, low RPM boost is easily built by using the brake pedal to pressurize the intake. Steering is properly weighted, and the bias is perfect for holding a drift. The Toyota Supra horsepower of 321 might seem low by today’s standards, but the actual output of the engine was much higher. Driving the car is an analog experience. There are no complicated screens to navigate or distract you. Listen to the intake and exhaust, and watch your boost gauge to shift at the right time. The Toyota Supra price is truly rewarding. </p>
